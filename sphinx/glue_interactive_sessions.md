# Glue interactive session for jupyter

Here we discuss the procedure to integrate a glue session in jupyter. Glue interactive sessions is for debugging on a small datasets,  please refer to the provided links in this document if the procedure is deprecated and update this document accordingly.

## debugging environment

Consider setting up a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) before using this feature.

## Python package Installation

Depending on your environment, you may need to run one of the following commands based on [glue_interactive sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/interactive-sessions.html):

``` bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade jupyter boto3 aws-glue-sessions
```

or

``` bash
pip install --user --upgrade jupyter boto3 aws-glue-sessions
```

## adding glue_spark extensions for jupyter

The following commands will add glue_spark/glue_pyspark extensions to jupyter based on [glue_interactive sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/interactive-sessions.html).

```bash
SITE_PACKAGES=$(pip3 show aws-glue-sessions | grep Location | awk '{print $2}')
jupyter kernelspec install $SITE_PACKAGES/aws_glue_interactive_sessions_kernel/glue_pyspark --user
jupyter kernelspec install $SITE_PACKAGES/aws_glue_interactive_sessions_kernel/glue_spark --user
```

## AWS CLI installation and configuration

### Installation

according to [getting started with AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html),
to install the AWS CLI use following commands:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws configure
```

Use your IAM role or user to configure the aws.

### configure aws using credentials

After installation, the command `aws sts get-caller-identity` should result in one of the followings:

```json
{
    "UserId": "THE_USER_ID",
    "Account": "ACCOUNT_NO",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/myIAMRole"
}
```

```json
{
    "UserId": "THE_USER_ID",
    "Account": "123456789123",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/MyIAMUser"
}

```

Which depends on if you set your aws for a user or based on a role. In first case which is when it is a role use:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name myIAMRole  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess
```

in the other case use:

```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyIAMUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess
```

Which would give you enough access to use this feature.

## Prepare the AWS Glue service role for interactive sessions

You can specify the second principal, GlueServiceRole, either in the notebook itself by using the `%iam_role` magic or stored alongside the AWS CLI config. If you have a role that you typically use with AWS Glue jobs, this will be that role. If you donâ€™t have a role you use for AWS Glue jobs, refer to [Setting up IAM permissions for AWS Glue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/getting-started-access.html) to set one up.
To edit the aws config file use the following, you can change code with the editor of your choice (for example `nano`):

### using credentials file

```bash
code ~/.aws/credentials
```

add the following to your config file:

```txt
glue_role_arn=arn:aws:iam::Account:role/service-role/<ROLE>
region=<defualt_region>
```

in which `ARN` is the [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html) of the role you made to be used for glue. You can find it using [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) by searching the role name or using CLI:

```bash
aws iam get-role --role-name <role name>
```

### Using jupyter magic role

You can use multiple magic roles in the session in which a complete list of them are given in [Interactive session magic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/interactive-sessions-magics.html) for lower cost we recommend the following magics:
Please have in mind that the below magics should be run **first before other cells are run** otherwise it will not affect the current session.

```python
%glue_version 3.0
%number_of_workers 2
%worker_type G.2X
%idle_timeout 15
```

each session is run after you run anything but the magic commands.
> **_NOTE:_**  Make sure to use `%idle_timeout` before each session is run and also to use `%stop_session` to avoid high costs. The cost is based on the number of workers per hour (0.44$ per hour) so also using least (2) `%number_of_workers 2` is recommended.
